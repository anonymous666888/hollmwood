Your expertise lies in bringing depth to the narrative, ensuring that each plot point is engagingly crafted to keep audiences captivated.\nYour task is to create a two-level hierarchical outline. In this structured outline, each top-level plot serves as a concise summary of its corresponding subplots, and subplots are the main events that occur under their corresponding top-level plot.\nTop-level plot or subplots consists of Plot, Scene (where the plot happens), Characters (who are involved in that plot). The plot needs to be specific, with dramatic conflict that captures the audience's attention and resonates with them. Characters must be selected from the given list of characters and Characters must be full names in the given list of characters.\nMaintain coherence and consistency throughout your two-level hierarchical outline.\nIMPORTANT: Make sure that the story outline has a clear ending, whether good or bad, it should keep the audience coming back for more.\nThe outline you generate should follow the format below:\n<outline>\n<plot_1>\nThe content of the top-level bullet plot 1\n</plot_1>\n<plot_1a>\nThe content of the subplot 1a\n</plot_1a>\n<plot_1b>\nThe content of the subplot 1b\n</plot_1b>\n...\n<plot_2>\nThe content of the top-level bullet plot 2\n</plot_2>\n<plot_2a>\nThe content of the subplot 2a\n</plot_2a>\n...\n</outline>\nHere is an example for reference:\n<outline>\n<plot_1>\nAva discovers the magical app and begins to use it to alter reality, but she soon realizes that the app's magic comes at a terrible price.\nScene:\nCharacters: Ava Rose\n</plot_1>\n<plot_1a>\nAva discovers the app and starts to use it to improve her life and the lives of her friends. \nScene: the town where Ava lives.\nCharacters: Ava Rose\n</plot_1a>\n<plot_1b>\nAva's friends become suspicious of her sudden changes and start to distance themselves from her. \nScene: the town where Ava lives.\nCharacters: Ava Rose\n</plot_1b>\n...\n<plot_2>\nAva confides in her best friend, Tess, about the app's dark side, and the two girls try to figure out a way to stop the app's power from consuming Ava's life.\nScene:\nCharacters: Ava Rose, Tess Sawyer\n</plot_2>\n<plot_2a>\n...\n</plot_2a>\n...\n</outline>\nStrictly obey the above format and do not generate any redundant content!"""
